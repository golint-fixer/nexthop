cli overview
------------

cli should be renamed server?

main <-> cli <-> clientList
                   client:
                     cli.commandChannel <- inputLoop <- clientSocket
                     client.outputChannel -> outputLoop -> clientSocket

inputLoop: read from socket, write to inputChannel(cmd)
outputLoop: read from client.outputChannel(output), write to socket
cli: manage multiple telnet sessions
     read from inputChannel, write to cli.commandChannel
	 can output to specific client.outputChannel(output)
	 can broadcast to all client.outputChannel(output)
main: read commands from commandChannel
      write command outputs to cli.output(client, message)
      read network route events
